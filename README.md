## Prerequisities
This application uses .NET Framework 4.8 which should be present in both Windows 10 (since v1903) and Windows 11. If for some reason you are missing the .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime Redistributable you can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer).

## SmartScreen warning
SmartScreen might warn you about unknown source when launching this application for the first time. This will happen until my personal Code-Signing certificate with which I sign the final .exe gains enough reputation with SmartScreen or until I get an EV Code-Signing certificate (which is not likely).
